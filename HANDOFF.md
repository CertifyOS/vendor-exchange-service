# HANDOFF

State of `vendor-exchange-service` at the end of the export lane subtask (CP-39605), and how work on it is done. Read `AGENTS.md` first; this file says where things stand, that one says how to work.

## Where things stand (2026-10-06)

- The scaffolding (CP-39604) is merged: PR #1 on `main` at `4e1e220`, findings 1 to 68.
- The export lane (CP-39605) is built, proven in CI and recorded, as a stack of pull requests against `main` to be merged in order: #2 schedule endpoints and template provisioning, #3 tick creates batches, run-now and the reconciler re-enqueue, #4 `SelectJob`, #5 `RequestEgressJob`, #6 completion (event handler, `DeadlineCheckJob`, `FinishJob`), #7 reads, retry and supersede, #8 the whole-lane proof, #9 this documentation. Each PR's diff collapses to its own step as the one below it merges. Findings 69 to 90 hold the gate evidence; finding 89 records the three end-to-end event sequences.
- Tests on the step 8 branch: 119 unit, 130 integration, 0 failures. Every endpoint in the design's section 3 is in `openapi/openapi.yaml` with problem+json responses; every audit event type is written by the code path the design names; every metric name is recorded where the design says.
- Deployment is still held (finding 67): `terraform/internal/` is the validated reference shape for the Pulumi component; no image is pushed. `docs/runbook.md` section 9 is the first live verification once the deployment and the egress changes exist.

## What is deliberately not done here

- Nothing in the lane is a stub any more. What remains is outside this repository: the egress changes the design asks for, the Auth0 machine client, the IAP grants, the bucket read grant, the Pub/Sub topic and bindings, the Pulumi deployment, the design-doc edits (ask A9, grown by `PRIOR_ATTEMPT` as a completion source, `userId vendor-exchange-worker`, the tick's 200, the file date being the first request's date).
- The mappings CSV ships with the open columns the design leaves open (`practitioner_phone`, `telehealth_url`, the group join, `Y/N` rendering) as documented placeholders (finding 69); a resolved vendor contract is a v2 of the CSV and a new template version, no code change.
- Phase 2, ingesting the vendor's response, is the next subtask under CP-39602 (CP-40438) and starts from `acknowledgedAt` and `inboundBatchId` on the batch document, which this lane only defines.

## What the next subtask starts from

- Lifecycle writes live in three classes, each one transaction with its events: `BatchLifecycle` (birth, selection, egress request), `BatchCompletion` (egress completed, failed at egress, delivered), `BatchOperations` (retry, supersede). Jobs call them; nothing else moves a batch. Add a transition there, never in a job or a resource.
- Jobs are the four handlers in `export/jobs/`, each `loadExpecting` its state first, so any job can be re-enqueued safely; `JobIds` makes ids deterministic and `JobEnqueuer` is the only enqueue point. `JobLogContext.currentJob()` is how a handler reads the JobRunr context (it throws if read the framework's way outside a worker, finding 78).
- The vendor bucket is `VendorBucket` (metadata only); `GcsVendorBucket` builds its client on first use. Tests mock the interface.
- Integration tests share one application per profile: use emails and tenants no other class uses, and `WireMockUpstreams.resetRequests()` before counting (finding 72). `EgressFixtures` builds batches in any state with the egress details the request job would have written. `ExportLaneIT` is the pattern for an end-to-end scenario on the worker role.
- Constructor injection is capped at seven parameters by Checkstyle; when a class needs an eighth, split by phase (findings 77d, 82) or route a read through a class that already holds the dependency (`BatchJobSupport.config()`, `BatchLifecycle.scheduleOf`).
- Nothing in `config/`, `persistence/`, `auth/`, `metrics/` or `terraform/` changed for the lane. `http/` gained `ProblemException` and two mappers (finding 71g), `clients/` gained the template list call and `VendorBucket`; both are recorded.

## Pending outside this repository

Listed with owners in `docs/runbook.md` sections 4 and 5, with the live verification in section 9: egress changes, Auth0 machine client, IAP grants on the DAL and api-layer backends, service-account and Pub/Sub bindings, vendor bucket read, DNS record, dedicated Atlas user, egress completion topic, DAL permission rows, Workload Identity for CI, Pulumi deployment, design-doc edits (ask A9). Also: `@suhasini-certify` needs write access on this repository for the CODEOWNERS entry to count.

## How work is done here

- One step at a time, with a gate: every step ends with CI green and a numbered finding in `docs/decisions.md` that states what was proven and what was not. Nothing moves to the next step without that.
- Nothing is assumed from memory about a framework: check the jar (`javap`), the source of the sibling service, or a running test. Findings 50, 53, 56, 61, 78 and 84 are each a case where the assumption was wrong and the check found it.
- The new-service playbook (Claude Doc "New Service Playbook: Lessons from api-layer and DAL") is the standard; its rules are enforced by ArchUnit and Checkstyle, not remembered.
- Locally: `make compile` and `make lint`, plus the unit test classes a change touches. The full suite runs in CI; integration tests need Docker. Never push with a failing local compile (finding 84 records the one time it happened).
- External writes (Jira, Confluence, access grants, `terraform apply`) are drafted or planned here and run by the engineer.
- Every deviation from the plan or the design is written down the day it happens, with the reason, in `docs/decisions.md`; a settled, hard-to-reverse choice becomes an ADR.
